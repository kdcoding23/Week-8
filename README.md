Promineo Tech's Week 8 assignment was to build upon Week 7's project of creating a multi-page website by adding CSS. I created a site that lists my favorite movies and TV shows at that time (using an unordered list) and recently read books (using a table). 

I had a lot of fun writing the CSS as I love designing how websites look. At the time, I was particulary proud of the list and tables (shown below), in which each odd list and table item is pink and every even item turns purple when hovered over.
